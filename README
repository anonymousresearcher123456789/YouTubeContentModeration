## 📁 Repository Structure

### 1. `ground_truth.csv`
- Contains the **final annotated dataset**.
- Each row corresponds to a video with the following fields:
  - `Video ID`
  - `Primary Label`
  - `Secondary Label`
  - `Translated Transcription`
  - `Native Transcription`
  - `Metadata (title, tags, thumbnail, channelTitle, description)`
  - `Languages` — indicates if a video was unavailable

---

### 2. `Appendix_AAAI.pdf`
Auxiliary material such as diagrams, video screenshots, prompt, cost breakdown:

---

### 3. `PythonNotebooks/`

Python notebooks used for processing, enrichment, and experimentation.

#### 🔹 Retrieval Pipelines
- `YouTube Videos Download.ipynb` – Source video collection and filtering
- `Download Video Metadata.ipynb` – Download and process auxiliary metadata

#### 🔹 Experiment Notebooks
Run and evaluate specific experiments using the labeled dataset

### 5. `Updated Codebook.pdf/`
- Final version of the annotation codebook used by human annotators  
- Includes detailed descriptions of primary and secondary labels
